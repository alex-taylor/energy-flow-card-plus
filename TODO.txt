Split-colour rings for grid and battery
  Optional

See if something can be done about the values spilling out of the circle?
  Maybe cap at 3dp?
  Draw the values with an opaque background?

Missing translations in the Advanced config options
  And quite possibly other missing localizations generally

Secondary info may not be working

Test the other entities
  And refactor the code out

README updates

Display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
  Or over the circles?

Option to disable animations

See if the entity_date_picker flag can be removed without breaking existing configs
  And get rid of the per-entity flags

Fix the duplicate 'use metadata' flags

Verify that metadata works

Test the Individual entities, which likely have similar math errors

Test multiple-entities for a single node

Option to 'grey out' the lines rather than hiding when inactive
  See the power-flow-card for the implementation

Dropdowns in the UI shouldn't allow text-entry in many cases

Whitespace option should be global

See if it's possible to pick up the built-in energy config for the sensors?

When loading, it displays the 'make sure you have a date-picker' message briefly

See if the stat-summing calculations can be cached - after all, the stats only update hourly or when the date-picker is changed

Check the timestamps of the stats coming back in Live and History/Hybrid modes - are they correct for the current TZ?
    Particularly Live, this may well be wrong
    Also check the start/end dates, see what's actually being passed around here
