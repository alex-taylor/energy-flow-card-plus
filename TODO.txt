BUGS
----

Secondary value being mis-coloured, needs to take into account the relevant setting

Secondary value not using the entity's units

Home Entity, Individual and Low-Carbon are not yet including live deltas
  - probably fixable by updating getEntityStateWattHours() in the main class to do this

Home icon/value colour calculation requires that we have a value for 'non-fossil' energy, which is never calculated
  - and in fact the entire low-carbon code is stuffed...

DisplayZeroTolerance missing from 'Home'

The Fossil Fuel circle shows the 'hand' cursor when no entity is set

Secondary_info etc being created in the default config
  - possible due to upgradeConfig()?
  - rework to check that the incoming config has the value before updating it




FEATURES
--------

Split-colour rings for grid and battery
  Optional

Display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
  Or over the circles?

Option to disable animations

Option to 'grey out' the lines rather than hiding when inactive
  See the power-flow-card for the implementation

See if it's possible to pick up the built-in energy config for the sensors?
  - this works with a new card with its default config, but as soon as you set and then remove an entity you lose it
  - so what we might want here is a toggle to switch between built-in config and explicit?



GENERAL
-------

README and CHANGELOG updates

Test multiple-entities for a single node
  And FossilFuel doesn't appear to support this yet
  Neither do Grid/Battery

Test localisation by disabling EN and checking that all strings revert to their keys

Remove the 'separated entities' accordion

Add things like 'units' to the Entity classes, to save lookups each time they are needed (eg in getTotalEnergy)

Secondary Info could be supported for Battery as well?

Rename 'Advanced' to 'Appearance', and move to top

Rework the UI to match Power Flow card?

'template' (in the Secondary Info entities) does not appear to have been implemented!
