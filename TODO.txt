BUGS
----

Home value still getting the wrong colour - usually 'low-carbon'

The 'loading...' flag doesn't seem to be getting cleared reliably
  - possibly now fixed

Secondary value being mis-coloured, needs to take into account the relevant setting

Secondary value not using the entity's units
  - this is because they are not being passed in

Home Entity, Individual are not yet including live deltas

Individual icon also coloured when the 'colour value' flag is set
  - 'colour icon' flags not working at all
  - oddly, doesn't affect low-carbon




FEATURES
--------

Bigger circles!
  - possibly dynamic if something can be figured out?

Display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
  Or over the circles?

See if it's possible to pick up the built-in energy config for the sensors?
  - this works with a new card with its default config, but as soon as you set and then remove an entity you lose it
  - if an entity is set, it overrides the built-in one, if present

Might need to support a vertical layout
  - either dynamic, based on available width and the number of Nodes to draw, or user-controlled
  - basically rotate right by 90

Perhaps support images?
  - eg have the Inverter shown in the middle?
  - what about the Battery?
    - might look odd
    - how to display the values?

  - watt to kilowatt threshold (number, defaults to 1000)
  - kilowatt to megawatt threshold (number, defaults to 1000)

'Flows':
  - min flow rate (number, defaults to 1)       -- there's no real need to allow these to be set, they're the values from the built-in card; but they are also used by the new calculations
  - max flow rate (number, defaults to 6)
  - min expected energy (number, defaults to 10)    -- only used by the 'new flow' calculations
  - max expected energy (number, defaults to 2000)

'Node'
  - name (string, optional, overrides the built-in name for the Grid/Gas/Solar/Battery/Home/Low-carbon nodes or the entity's own name for the Devices)
  - icon (string, optional, overrides the built-in icon for the Grid/Gas/Solar/Battery/Home/Low-carbon nodes or the entity's own icon for the Devices)
  - SecondaryInfo

'SingleValueNode':'Node'
  - entities (array of Entity)
  - colour (rgb, optional, overrides the built-in colour)
      - need a means to remove it again

'DualValueNode':'Node'
  - consumption (array of Entity)
  - production (array of Entity)

  - colour of icon (enum, none, dynamic, consumption, production, consumption sources, defaults to none)
  - colour of circle (enum, dynamic, consumption, production, consumption sources, defaults to dynamic)
  - colour values (boolean, it will follow 'colour of circle' when true, defaults to false)

'Entity'
  - id (optional, overrides the HASS config for the Grid/Solar/Battery/Gas/Low-carbon nodes, for Device it controls whether the node is shown)
  - units (optional, overrides the entity's own units)
  - display zero threshold (optional, defaults to 0)
  - decimals (optional, defaults to no value)

'Home':'Node'
  - colour of icon (enum, none, dynamic, solar, high-carbon, battery, low-carbon, defaults to none)
  - colour of value (enum, none, dynamic, solar, high-carbon, battery, low-carbon, defaults to none)
