BUGS
----

'template' (in the Secondary Info entities) does not appear to have been implemented!

Home icon/value colour calculation requires that we have a value for 'non-fossil' energy, which is never calculated

DisplayZeroTolerance missing from 'Home'

If no statistics are available (eg, at the start of the period before the first hour's have been produced) we are displaying zeroes in Live/Hybrid modes - this could be handled by using the sensor values, so long as they are 'today' and not 'total' or something...
  - check again at midnight
  - we can handle 'total' sensors if the config tells us that's what they are: this would require a boolean property on each entity config

If the Home entity is displayed, it's showing the wrong value
  - possibly a misconfigured sensor, check again on Monday

Home Entity, Individual etc are not yet including live deltas
  - probably fixable by updating getEntityStateWattHours() in the main class to do this
  - can't be tested until Home Entity display is working again


FEATURES
--------

Split-colour rings for grid and battery
  Optional

Display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
  Or over the circles?

Option to disable animations

Option to 'grey out' the lines rather than hiding when inactive
  See the power-flow-card for the implementation

See if it's possible to pick up the built-in energy config for the sensors?




GENERAL
-------

README and CHANGELOG updates

Test the Individual entities, which likely have similar math errors

Test multiple-entities for a single node
  And FossilFuel doesn't appear to support this yet
  Neither do Grid/Battery

Test localisation by disabling EN and checking that all strings revert to their keys

Remove the 'separated entities' accordion

Add things like 'units' to the Entity classes, to save lookups each time they are needed (eg in getTotalEnergy)

Secondary Info could be supported for Battery as well?
