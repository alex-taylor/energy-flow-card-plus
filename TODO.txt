BUGS
----

Still got bugs with the mignight rollover

Reinstate the -ve coords for the lines, they are required so that the dots don't just vanish!
  - and presumably they should extend at both ends?

Home value still getting the wrong colour - usually 'low-carbon'
  - the circle gets it wrong at midnight, too

The 'loading...' flag doesn't seem to be getting cleared reliably
  - possibly now fixed
  - should, however, display the circles but with 'Unknown' for their values

Secondary value being mis-coloured, needs to take into account the relevant setting

Secondary value not using the entity's units
  - this is because they are not being passed in

Home Entity, Individual are not yet including live deltas

Individual icon also coloured when the 'colour value' flag is set
  - 'colour icon' flags not working at all
  - oddly, doesn't affect low-carbon




FEATURES
--------

If data is still loading when we render, go ahead and render the circles/lines anyway, just put 'loading' for the values

Bigger circles!
  - possibly dynamic if something can be figured out?

Display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
  Or over the circles?

See if it's possible to pick up the built-in energy config for the sensors?
  - this works with a new card with its default config, but as soon as you set and then remove an entity you lose it
  - if an entity is set, it overrides the built-in one, if present

Might need to support a vertical layout
  - either dynamic, based on available width and the number of Nodes to draw, or user-controlled
  - basically rotate right by 90

Perhaps support images?
  - eg have the Inverter shown in the middle?
  - what about the Battery?
    - might look odd
    - how to display the values?



GENERAL
-------

Move the sensor type-detection to the init code, it only needs to be done once per session
  - change _entitiesArr to a Map where the keys are the IDs and the values are the types
  - might as well do the type as an enum, and track all three values


README and CHANGELOG updates

Test localisation by disabling EN and EN-GB and checking that all strings revert to their keys
