BUGS
----

Secondary info may not be working

Home icon/value colour calculation requires that we have a value for 'non-fossil' energy, which is never calculated

DisplayZeroTolerance missing from 'Home'



FEATURES
--------

Split-colour rings for grid and battery
  Optional

Display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
  Or over the circles?

Option to disable animations

Option to 'grey out' the lines rather than hiding when inactive
  See the power-flow-card for the implementation

See if it's possible to pick up the built-in energy config for the sensors?




GENERAL
-------

README and CHANGELOG updates

Test the other entities
  And refactor the code out

Verify that metadata works

Test the Individual entities, which likely have similar math errors

Test multiple-entities for a single node
  And FossilFuel doesn't appear to support this yet
  Neither do Grid/Battery

Test localisation by disabling EN and checking that all strings revert to their keys

Remove the 'separated entities' accordion

Add things like 'units' to the Entity classes, to save lookups each time they are needed (eg in getTotalEnergy)

Test Non-Fossil
